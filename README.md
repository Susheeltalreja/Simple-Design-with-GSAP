<p>It is a simple practice project which focuses on utilizing <b>GSAP</b> (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create smooth, interactive animations on a webpage. The project aims to showcase the power of GSAP by implementing various animation effects such as scroll-triggered animations, hover transitions, and element reveals. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with GSAP's powerful animation tools, improving both my coding skills and my understanding of dynamic web design. It serves as a great foundation for learning and experimenting with modern web animation techniques.</p>
